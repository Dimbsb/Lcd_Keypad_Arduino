#Lcd_Keypad_Arduino

This Arduino Uno project involves developing an application that interacts with an LCD and a 4x3 keypad. 
Initially, the LCD will display the user's student ID followed by the first 10 letters of their last name on the first line. 
The system continuously accepts two integer inputs (0-9) from the keypad, displaying them in the first two positions of the second line. 
Non-numeric inputs are ignored. Once both digits are entered, the LCD displays the square of the two-digit number starting from the fifth position of the second line. 
This project demonstrates basic input handling and display output using Arduino.
The project is tested by running the generated hex file in PICSimLab, a virtual laboratory for microcontroller simulations, ensuring proper functionality and performance.
